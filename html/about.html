        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>
          ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with
          gyms opening throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area. Whether your
          goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements,
          having more energy, or just looking and feeling better - we're here
          for you!<br />
          Our trainers are all
          <span>Les Mills accredited instructors</span> and all have Bachelor
          Degrees in Human Movements. We are a family operated business that has
          little to do with the rest of the fitness industry.<br />
          You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own
          pace, with no pressure whatsoever. Our 'no obligation, no pressure'
          attitude is clearly evident with our
          <span> $10 CASUAL visit rate</span>.<br />We have created gyms that we
          would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our
          valued members. We are open <span> 24:7</span>. YOU can now train any
          time you like, weekdays, weekends & public holidays. We are staffed
          all the time. If you need a late night workout, a protein bar or
          shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for you. Our class
          times change constantly so check out on the web site for the timetable
          at each of our clubs.
