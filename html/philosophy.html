          Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing. I
          competed as an amateur in my early years and now like to share my
          knowledge and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to jump
          into the ring as your sparring partner. <br />
          For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the boxing scene.
          He has competed as an amateur in his early years and now shares his
          knowledge and expertise as a coach, by running his boxing classes with
          passion and enthusiasm.
          <br />
          The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun, exciting and highly
          energised. <br />
          Whether it is your first class or you're an intermediate level boxer,
          you will gain a lot by becoming involved. It is one of the best
          cardiovascular workouts available.
